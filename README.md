# Warsmash Windows Wrapper
This repository is a simple Visual Studio project to create an EXE that will launch the Warsmash mod engine on Windows 10.
Warsmash is made in Java so for the average user if we did not have an EXE like this, we would then require the user to install Java and learn how to do all of that, and that might annoy some users, since most common Warcraft 3 players are likely to associate Java with the annoying popup on their computer from 2005-2015 that asked for updates despite not doing anything, rather than to associate it with a programming language.
